# West Nile Virus
## Predicting outbreaks in Chicago

By Diego Rodriguez, Matt Bollinger, Natalie Olivo, Kyle Santana, and myself

This project was inspired by the Kaggle competition here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus

Utilizing weather, geographic, and mosquito collection data from Chicago, my team was able to build a model that predicted where and when mosquito populations would increase and if they would be likely carriers of the West Nile Virus. We then did a cost-benefit analysis on the effects of spraying pesticide to control the mosquito population and thus the spread of the disease. Our model was able to predict 81% of actual cases of WNV based on our test data.  We also score a .77355 on the Roc Auc score (used to find the winner on Kaggle).
